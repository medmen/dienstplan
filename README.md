# dienstplan
a Duty roster respecting wishes and obeying rules

dienstplan is a simple PHP based duty roster. It works with a trial and error approach applying rules like
* no consecutive duties
* even distribution 
* maximum duties on weekends
and supports wishes (duty/no duty at a certain date)

So far, dienstplan ist one-dimensional and kept as simple as possible. 
No support for different duty types, no database (data stored in arrays).
